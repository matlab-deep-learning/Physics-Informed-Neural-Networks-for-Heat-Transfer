# Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Heat Transfer


In recent years, Physics-Informed Neural Networks[1] are applied to various types of application tasks. 
This example shows how to train a neural network using data calculated with partial differential equations(PDEs), and heat equation as loss function to predict temperature distributions.
